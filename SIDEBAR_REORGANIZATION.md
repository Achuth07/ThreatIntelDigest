# Sidebar Reorganization

This document describes the change made to reorganize the sidebar layout by moving the Quick Actions section below the Filters section.

## Change Made

Moved the "Quick Actions" section to appear immediately after the "Filters" section in the sidebar, instead of at the bottom of the sidebar.

## Before

The sidebar structure was:
1. Filters
2. Threat Intel Sources
3. Vulnerabilities
4. Quick Actions (at the bottom)

## After

The sidebar structure is now:
1. Filters
2. Quick Actions
3. Threat Intel Sources
4. Vulnerabilities

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Quick actions are now more prominently placed right after the filters
2. **Improved User Flow**: Users can quickly access common actions after setting their filters
3. **Logical Grouping**: Related functionality (filters and actions) are grouped together
4. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Quick actions are more visible to users

## Implementation

The change was implemented by:
1. Moving the entire "Quick Actions" section JSX block
2. Placing it immediately after the "Filters" section
3. Maintaining all existing functionality and styling

## Testing

To verify the change:
1. Open the application
2. Check that the sidebar shows Filters first
3. Verify that Quick Actions appear immediately after Filters
4. Confirm that Threat Intel Sources and Vulnerabilities sections still appear below
5. Test that all buttons and functionality work as expected

## Additional Notes

- No functional changes were made, only layout reorganization
- All existing functionality remains intact
- The change improves the user interface without affecting performance
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained
