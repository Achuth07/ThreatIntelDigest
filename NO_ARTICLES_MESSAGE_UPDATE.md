# No Articles Message Update

This document describes the update made to the message displayed when no articles are available.

## Change Made

Updated the message shown to users when no articles are available to suggest adjusting the Time range filter in addition to the existing message about feeds being loaded.

## Before

When no articles were available, the message was:
```
Articles will appear here once feeds are loaded
```

## After

The updated message is:
```
Articles will appear here once feeds are loaded. Try adjusting your Time range filter.
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Guidance**: Users are now given a specific action they can take to see articles
2. **Improved User Experience**: Helps users troubleshoot why they're not seeing articles
3. **Increased Engagement**: Encourages users to interact with the filters to find content
4. **Reduced Confusion**: Provides clear direction instead of leaving users wondering what to do

## Implementation

The change was made in the home page component where the "No articles available" message is displayed. The update adds a suggestion to adjust the Time range filter to the existing message.

## Testing

To verify the change:
1. Open the application
2. Select a source that has no articles within the current time filter
3. Verify that the updated message is displayed
4. Confirm that the message includes the suggestion to adjust the Time range filter

## Additional Notes

- The change only affects the message text, no functional changes were made
- The update maintains consistency with the existing UI design and styling
- The message still appears only when no articles are available after all filters are applied
- The suggestion to adjust filters is relevant since the Time range filter is one of the primary ways to control which articles are displayed
